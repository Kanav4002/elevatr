## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **MongoDB** (local instance or connection string)
- **Groq API Key** — Get one free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kanav4002/elevatr.git
cd elevatr
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/elevatr
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
PORT=4000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Start the backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:5173**

---

## Docker Deployment

Run the entire stack with a single command:

```bash
# Set your Groq API key
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

# Start all services
docker compose up --build
```

This spins up:
- **MongoDB** on port `27017`
- **Backend API** on port `4000`
- **Frontend** (Nginx) on port `5173`

## AI Integration

Elevatr uses **Groq** with the **Llama 3.3 70B Versatile** model for AI features:

- **ATS Resume Analysis** — Reads the actual PDF resume text using `pdf-parse`, combines it with profile data, and sends it to Groq for comprehensive analysis against a job description. Returns score, keyword matching, strengths, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions.
- **Interview Questions** — Generates role-specific technical, behavioral, and situational questions tailored to the job title and company.
- **Fallback System** — If the AI service is unavailable, both features gracefully fall back to keyword-based logic so users are never blocked.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_URL` | Yes | MongoDB connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | Secret key for JWT signing |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Yes | Groq API key for AI features |
| `PORT` | No | Backend port (default: `4000`) |
| `CLIENT_URL` | No | Frontend URL for CORS (default: `http://localhost:5173`) |
